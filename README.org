* NixOS on Radxa Rock 5B

KireinaHoro: Panfork is removed since upstream is dead.  Kodi is also removed
since I don't use it in my installation.  The idea is to use upstream Linux [[https://gitlab.collabora.com/hardware-enablement/rockchip-3588/notes-for-rockchip-3588/-/blob/main/mainline-status.md][as tracked here]], after USB-C support is finished.

This repo contains my opinionated infrastructure to run NixOS on the [[https://wiki.radxa.com/Rock5/5b][Radxa Rock 5B]].
It also provides a substituer (powered by Cachix) and it supports cross compilation.


** How to flash the eMMC

A no brain automatic flashing script is in progress, meanwhile:

#+begin_src sh
  # delete all partitions on /dev/sda (assuming it is the eMMC)
  $ nix build .#uboot
  $ sudo dd if=result/shared.disk-image.img of=/dev/sda
  $ nix build .#rootfs
  # create a new partion /dev/sda2 in the remaining free space
  $ sudo dd if=$(readlink result) of=/dev/sda2 status=progress
  # mark /dev/sda2 as legacy bootable (for example using fdisk advanced options)
#+end_src

I haven't tested (yet) booting from other devices but I heard of
people being able to do so.
